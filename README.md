# ETHBegProj
This is a Solidity Program that simulates the minting and burning of tokens. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my current knowledge of the programming language, and to further enhance in the future.

# Description
This program mints and burns a singular token, using variable and functions from the Solidity programming language. For the mint function, it adds value to the token, while the burn functions reduces the value of the token. A conditional statement is also added to the burn function so that the token has sufficient value.

# Getting Started
## Executing Program
To run this program, you have to use the online Remix IDE, which accepts and compiles Solidity code. 
Here is the website address as well as the code used for this project:

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.
*/

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Ultima";
    string public tokenAbbreviation = "ult";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balance;

    // mint function
    function mintToken(address _address, uint _value) public{
        totalSupply += _value;
        balance[_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burnToken(address _address, uint _value) public{
        
        //If statement to make sure that the provided address's balance is sufficient before burning token
        if(balance[_address] >= _value){
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balance[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }
}
```

## Naming the Token
The token should be named with variable as well as the token's address. Those factors are named tokenName and tokenAbbreviation. The total supply of your token is also named totalSupply.

## Minting the Token
Clicking the mintToken function button from the Deploy tab activates the function itself. It needs the correct values for it to occur, specifically the token address and the value to be minted into the address and the total supply.

## Burning the Token
Clicking the mintToken function button from the Deploy tab reduces the token's total supply and address. It needs the token's address and the value to be burnt. However, the token's balance must be sufficient to be burnt by the entered value, otherwise, it will return an error.

## Error Handling
The new file in the project, ETHErrorHandling.sol, adds the error handling functions: Assert, Require, and Revert. The two first functions are used as validation functions, checking whether their parameters are met or not. The revert function is an automatic function that forcibly reverts the actions of the main function. 
Here is the source code of ETHErrorHandling.sol:
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Ultima";
    string public tokenAbbreviation = "ult";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balance;

    // mint function
    function mintToken(address _address, uint _value) public{
        require(_value <= 12000 && totalSupply <= 12000);
        totalSupply += _value;
        balance[_address] += _value;
        assert(totalSupply <= 12000);
    }

    // burn function
    function burnToken(address _address, uint _value) public{
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balance[_address] -= _value;
        if(totalSupply < 0){
            revert();
        }
    }
}
```
The Assert and Require functions are used in the MintToken function, checking whether the inputted value and the value of totalSupply have reached 12000. The Revert function is used in an if-statement in which checks if the totalSupply is less than zero.
